# javascript_challenge: JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Background:
We have a collection containing all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove aliens exist. All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.
There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. 
We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages that we can utilize at this time.


Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided.

Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.

Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
